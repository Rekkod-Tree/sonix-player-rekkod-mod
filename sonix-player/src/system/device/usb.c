// can push 5 V back out, so the socket can be either end of a cable. Left to
// itself the controller advertises both and negotiates, which against a PC is
// no contest -- a PC only ever sources -- and this device lands as the
// peripheral every time.
//
// Against a phone it is a contest, and one this device tends to win. A phone is
// dual-role too and Android implements Try.SNK, meaning it would rather be the
// sink; so the two agree that the DAP is the host, the boost turns on, the DAP
// charges the phone, and the card is never offered to anything. From the user's
// side: "nothing happens". The stock player has exactly one function for this
// (set_usb_working_mode at 0x481f20 in hiby_player): it writes "sink" or "dual"
// to /sys/class/typec/port0/port_type and re-applies the saved choice at every
// boot, which is the "USB working mode: Device / Host" item in its menu.
//
// The host half is in use as well: USB-C headphones and USB DACs live on it
// (usbaudio.c). So the role is not pinned -- it is arbitrated, in
// arbitrate_port() over there, and the rule is that the port is dual while it
// is empty and becomes sink again a few seconds after something attaches that
// does not turn into a sound card. A phone is exactly that case; a port pinned
// dual for good could never connect to one.
//
// This function is the sink half of that rule, kept here because it also runs
// before the gadget is bound: it is the role that decides whether the
// controller has a gadget side at all.
//
// The R1 has none of this: no FUSB302B and no Type-C class, but a TCS1421 set
// through its own platform attribute. Its role is looked after entirely by the
// arbitration in usbaudio.c, and this function does nothing there.
